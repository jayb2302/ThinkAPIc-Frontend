## üîó API

This frontend connects to the [ThinkAPIc REST API](https://github.com/jayb2302/ThinkAPIc).

## üöÄ Getting Started
### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jayb2302/ThinkAPIc-Frontend.git
cd thinkapic-frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Configure API Endpoint
Create a `.env` file and set the API URL:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
```

This variable is used to configure where the frontend sends requests. During development, you can use:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
```


### 4. Run the Development Server
```sh
npm run dev
```

### üß© PrimeVue Setup

PrimeVue is used as the UI framework. You need to install the core library and the default theme:

```bash
npm install primevue primeicons
```

Also import the theme and base styles in `main.ts`:

```ts
import 'primevue/resources/themes/lara-light-teal/theme.css'; // or another theme
import 'primevue/resources/primevue.min.css';
import 'primeicons/primeicons.css';
```

And register PrimeVue components globally:

```ts
import PrimeVue from 'primevue/config';
app.use(PrimeVue);
```

> ‚úÖ Note: Some components like `Toast`, `Dialog`, and `ConfirmPopup` require additional setup in the component tree.
